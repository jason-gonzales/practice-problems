//Define function named spellChecker that takes in 2 arguments, an array of user typed string words, and
//an array of correctly spelled string words.
//Function will return 2 arrays
//One array will contain words that are spelled correctly
//Second array will contain the words which were spelled incorrectly

//Pseudo code
//inside the function create 2 empty storage space (empty arrays), one for the correct words and one for incorrect words
//run a for loop of the values in the array that is being called to access the strings in the arrays
//make a conditional statement to see if the strings in the array match, and if they do, push to the correct words array
//else if they do not match, push to the incorrect array
//return both the correct spelling array and incorrect spelling array
