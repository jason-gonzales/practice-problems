  /*You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

  Example

  For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
  depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

  Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

  year 0: 100;
  year 1: 120;
  year 2: 144;
  year 3: 172.8.
  Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the answer is 3.*/

    function depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) {
      let year = 0;

      while (threshold > deposit) {
        deposit += deposit * (rate / 100)
        console.log(deposit)
        year++
      }
      return year;
    }


    /*PS
    - make a counter variable that will add 1 every year you are still
      less than the value of threshhold
    - run a (while) loop that will multiply the value of rate/100 to the
      value of deposit and doing an additional assignment, which will
      add the value of the right operand to the deposit variable and assign
      the result to the variable, while the deposit is less than the value
      of threshold
    - increment the value of year inside the loop
    - return the value of year
