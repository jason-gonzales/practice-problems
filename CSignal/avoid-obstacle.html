  // You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of
    // obstacles situated on a straight line.

    // Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to
    // the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length
    // represented by some integer.

    // Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

    // Example

    // For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be
    // avoidObstacles(inputArray) = 4.

    function avoidObstacles(inputArray) {

    /*starting from 0, find the lowest number that does not divide perfectly
    into any of the obstacle numbers. Use every() to find out if element equally
    divides to zero. If it does its gonna be false and nothing happens.
    If its true, then we found the number which is the value of i.
