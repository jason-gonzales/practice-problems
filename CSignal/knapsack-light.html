<script>/*You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs
weight1 and is worth value1, and the second item weighs weight2 and
is worth value2. What is the total maximum value of the items you can
take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you
can't come back for the items later?

Note that there are only two items and you can't bring more than one
item of each type, i.e. you can't take two first items or two second items.

Example

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 8, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 10.

You can only carry the first item.

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 9, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 16.

You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.

For value1 = 5, weight1 = 3, value2 = 7, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 6, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 7.

You can't take both items, but you can take any of them.*/

  function knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) {
    if (weight1 + weight2 <= maxW) { //can we cary both items
      return value1 + value2;
    } else if (weight1 <= maxW && weight2 > maxW) { //can we carry item1 but not item2
      return value1;
    } else if (weight2 <= maxW && weight1 > maxW) { //can we carry item2 but not item1
      return value2;
    } else if (weight1 > maxW && weight2 > maxW) { //return 0 if both items are too heavy
      return 0
    } else {
      if (value1 > value2) {
        return value1;
      } else {
        return value2;
      }
    }
  }

  /*ps
  - can we carry both items
  - can we carry item1 but not item2
  - can we carry item2 but not item1
  - if both items are too heavy
  - if value1 is greater than value2 then return value1
  - else return value2
