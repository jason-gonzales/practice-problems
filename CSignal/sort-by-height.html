  // Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

    // Example

    // For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
    // sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].



    function sortByHeight(a) {
      let array2 = a;

      array2 = array2.filter(el => {
        if (el != -1) {
          return el
        }
      }).sort((a, b) => {
        return a - b;
      })

      let indexVal = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== -1) {
          a[i] = array2[indexVal]
          indexVal++
        }
      }

      return a;
    }

//create a second array and filter out the -1 values, then sort the remaining values
//make a variable that will keep track of what index we are on in array2 to inject to original a
//run a forloop to inject the number into that spot where -1 is not in the index of original a
//increment indexVal
