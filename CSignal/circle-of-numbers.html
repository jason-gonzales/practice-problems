  /*
  Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way
   that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal
   (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).

  Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite
   position to firstNumber.

  Example

  For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
  circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.
  */

    function circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) {
      let halfWay = n / 2; //5
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (firstNumber < halfWay) {
          console.log(firstNumber + halfWay) //2 + 5
          return firstNumber + halfWay; // 7

        }
      }
      return firstNumber - halfWay;
    }

    /*PS
    - divide the number of points in a circle by 2
    - run a loop of the points in the circle (n)
    - if the value of firstNumber is less than the halfWay point,
    - then add the value of firstNumber to the value of halfWay
    - if its not less than the halfway number,
    - then substract the value of halfWay from the value of firstNumber*/
