  /*Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly,
  you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases
  by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of
  sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented
   by downSpeed.

  Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially.
  Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll
  take for the plant to reach this height.

  Example

  For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output
  should be growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10. */

    function growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) {
      let days = 0;
      let height = 0;

      while (height < desiredHeight) {
        height += upSpeed
        days++
        console.log("before", height)
        if (height < desiredHeight) {
          height -= downSpeed;
          console.log("after", height)
        }
      }
      return days
    }


    /*ps
    - set a variable to 0 as the initial height of the plant
    - run a loop that will do an additional assignment that will store
      all the added value of upSpeed into the value of height,
      WHILE height is still less than the value of desiredHeight
    - make a conditional IF statement, since if the value of height after
      the additional assignment is still less than the desired height,
    - then you do a subtraction assignment that substracts the values of
      downSpeed and then stores it in the height variable
    - return the incrememented value of days
