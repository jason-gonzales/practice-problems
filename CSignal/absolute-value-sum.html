  /*
  Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

  abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
  (where abs denotes the absolute value)

  If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

  Example

  For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 4.

  for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7.
  for x = 4, the value will be abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 4) + abs(7 - 4) = 5.
  for x = 7, the value will be abs(2 - 7) + abs(4 - 7) + abs(7 - 7) = 8.
  The lowest possible value is when x = 4, so the answer is 4.*/

    function absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) {
      return a.length % 2 === 0 ? a[a.length / 2 - 1] : a[Math.floor(a.length / 2)]
    }

    /*PS
    - get the boolean value of if the length of a is an even or an odd number
    - if its an even number then, divide length of a by 2 and substract one and
      assign that value as the index of a
    - if its an odd number then, still divide the length of a by 2 and then math floor,
      afterward make that value the index of a
    - return a
